**A platform for reproducible research with modern tools**

Our group focuses on three main problems: How do we organize a research workflow in a
reproducible and efficient way? How can we utilize methods developed in one project
across multiple projects? And how can we implement research software in an extensible
fashion?

We thus develop software of various kinds. On this site we group it into

1. [**General Purpose Tools**](/tools/). Our most developed package is
   [optimagic](http://github.com/optimagic-dev/optimagic), a library for
   non-linear optimization with or without constraints. Other helpful tools forming the
   basis of many of our projects are
   [pybaum](http://github.com/opensourceeconomics/pybaum) and
   [dags](http://github.com/opensourceeconomics/dags).
2. [**Workflow Tools**](/workflow/). The basis of our projects is reproducibility. Often
   researchers hijack build systems for this. However, these are not designed for the
   typical research workflow and are thus
   inefficient. [pytask](http://github.com/pytask-dev/pytask) provides an alternative, a
   workflow management system inspired by
   [pytest](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest). Newcomers can migrate their project
   to our workflow tools using the
   [econ-project-templates](http://github.com/opensourceeconomics/econ-project-templates)
   or for more experienced users the bare
   [cookiecutter-pytask-project](https://github.com/pytask-dev/cookiecutter-pytask-project)
   template.
3. [**Economic Models and Applications**](/models/). We provide numerous packages that
   solve certain types of models. Examples are life-cycle models (lcm), dynamic latent
   factor models (skillmodels) and actual applications, for example, contact models in
   the context of covid (sid).

Locally and virtually, we organize [events](/events/) and teach courses on effective
programming practices.
