**A platform for reproducible research with modern tools**

The advent of ever powerful computers, raises new challenges for computational
economists and other computational scientists:

1. Models become more and more complex, rendering traditional workflows ineffective.
   Researchers have to learn about software engineering to enable collaboration in
   larger groups, re-use code across projects and keep complexities manageable. We
   provide courses and online materials to teach basic software engineering to
   scientists. You can find the material [here](./research-and-teaching).

2. Large scale models still require the use of efficient algorithms, implementations and
   hardware. Economists do not have to become experts in each of these areas but use
   modern tools for just in time compilation, GPU computing, automatic differentiation,
   numerical optimization, etc. We provide high quality tool packages for numerical
   optimization, differentiation and statistical inference as well as packages that
   implement economic models in a flexible and user friendly way using jax, numpy and
   the modern scientific Python stack. You can find the material [here](./software).

3. To make large projects reproducible, every step from data management to compilation
   of the final paper needs to be fully automated. We provide teaching materials and
   templates for reproducible research. You can find the material [here](./software).

Many of our tools and teaching materials are also useful for scientists from other
disciplines. We are supported by the [TRA Modelling](https://www.uni-bonn.de/en/research-and-teaching/research-profile/transdisciplinary-research-areas/tra-1-modelling)
and partner with computer scientists and applied mathematicians to further improve our
tools. We  are open to contributions, collaborations and feature requests across
disciplines.
