**A platform for reproducible research with modern tools**

Our group focuses on three main problems: How do we organize a research workflow in a
reproducible and efficient way? How can we utilize methods developed in one project
across mulitple projects? And, how can we implement research software in an extensible
fashion?

Research projects have become more and more complex, rendering traditional workflows
ineffective. Researchers have to learn about software engineering to enable
collaboration in larger groups, re-use code across projects and keep complexities
manageable. We provide [courses](./teaching) and
[online materials](./teaching#online-material) to teach basic software engineering to
scientists. To make large projects reproducible, every step from data management to
compilation of the final paper needs to be fully automated. To guide researchers in this
area we develop [Workflow Tools](./software#workflow-tools), that automatically take
care of most of the labor.

Computational projects often require even more tools, for example the use of efficient
algorithms, implementations and hardware. Researchers do not have to become experts in
each of these areas to use modern tools like GPU computing, automatic differentiation,
etc. We provide [Methodological Tools](./software#methodological-tools)
for optimization, differentiation and statistical inference that allow researchers to
utilize modern computing techniques with an easy-to-use interface.

To see some examples where we combine a reproducible workflow with our methodological
tools, see our [Research Software](./software#research-software).

Many of our tools and teaching materials are also useful for scientists from other
disciplines. We partner with computer scientists and applied mathematicians to further
improve our tools. We  are open to contributions, collaborations and feature requests
across disciplines.
