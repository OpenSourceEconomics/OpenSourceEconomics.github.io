## Research

### E<sup>2</sup>: Economics meets Epidemiology

**Funding** [Volkswagenstiftung](https://www.volkswagenstiftung.de/){:target="_blank"}

## Education

### Scientific Computing Course

The sound analysis of computational economic models requires expertise in economics, statistics, numerical methods, and software engineering. The course provides an overview of basic numerical methods for optimization, numerical integration, approximation methods, and uncertainty quantification. Students deepen their understanding of each of these topics in the context of a dynamic model of human capital accumulation using [respy](https://respy.readthedocs.io){:target="_blank"}. The last segment of the course welcomes several guest lecturers from the industry and other academic departments to present on how computational models are used in their everyday work. Please see our [course website](https://ose-scientific-computing.readthedocs.io){:target="_blank"} for details.
