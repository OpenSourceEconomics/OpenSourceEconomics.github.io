We maintain several software packages in support of our research and educational activities.

### ``respy``

``respy`` is an open source framework written in Python for the simulation and estimation of some finite-horizon discrete choice dynamic programming models. The group of models which can be currently represented in respy are called Eckstein–Keane–Wolpin models.

### ``pydsge``

``pydsge`` is a Python package that allows to simulate, filter, and estimate DSGE models with occassionaly binding constraints. It allows to conduct full-blown Bayesian estimations (including Bayesian filtering) of macroeconomic models featuring an endogenous zero lower bound on nominal interest rates.

### ``estimagic``

``estimagic`` is a Python package that helps to build high-quality and user friendly implementations of (structural) econometric models. It is designed with large structural models in mind. However, it is also useful for any other estimator that numerically minimizes or maximizes a criterion function. Examples include maximum likelihood, generalized method of moments, method of simulated moments and indirect inference.

### ``robupy``

``robupy`` is an open-source Python package for finding worst-case probabilities in the context of robust decision making. It aims to collect algorithms, which find for different construction methods for the ambiguity set, the worst-case distribution as fast as possible.

**Documentation** [robupy.readthedocs.io](https://robupy.readthedocs.io)

### ``econsieve``

``econsieve`` is a collection of nonlinear bayesian filters, in particular for high dimensional models. The filters are implemented in python. It provides the Transposed-Ensemble Kalman Filter (TEnKF) for state and likelihood inference, and the nonlinear path-adjustment filter (NPAS) for exact smoothed states.

### ``econsa``

``econsa`` is an open-source package for economists that facilitates the sound analysis of computational economic models. It offers suitable methods for uncertainty propagation and global sensitivity analysis. Please visit our online documentation for details.

### ``ruspy``

``ruspy`` is an open-source package for the simulation and estimation of a prototypical infinite-horizon dynamic discrete choice model based on [Rust (1987)](https://doi.org/10.2307/1911259){:target="_blank"}.

**Documentation** [ruspy.readthedocs.io](https://ruspy.readthedocs.io)

### ``grmpy``

``grmpy`` is an open-source Python package for the simulation and estimation of the generalized Roy model. It serves as a teaching tool to promote the conceptual framework of the generalized Roy model, illustrate a variety of issues in the econometrics of policy evaluation, and showcases basic software engineering practices.

### ``temfpy

``temfpy`` is an open-source package providing test models and functions for standard numerical components in computational economic models.
