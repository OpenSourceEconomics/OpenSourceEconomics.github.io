We maintain several software packages in support of our research and educational
activities. Some of our projects aim to facilitate research itself or make it more
reproducible. These will be found in section [Tools](#Tools). Our research projects are
seperated into methods, which are found in section
[Computational Methods](#computational-methods), and implementations of economic models,
which are found in [Economic Modelling Packages](#economic-modelling-packages).

## <ins>*Tools*</ins>

``econ-project-templates`` aims to provide project templates for economists that make it
easy to produce reproducible research using one or more of the most frequently used
programming languages in economics (i.e., Python, Stata, R, Julia).

``estimagic`` is a Python package that helps to build high-quality and user friendly
implementations of (structural) econometric models. It is designed with large structural
models in mind. However, it is also useful for any other estimator that numerically
minimizes or maximizes a criterion function. Examples include maximum likelihood,
generalized method of moments, method of simulated moments and indirect inference.

``robupy`` is an open-source Python package for finding worst-case probabilities in the
context of robust decision making. It aims to collect algorithms, which find for
different construction methods for the ambiguity set, the worst-case distribution as
fast as possible.

``econsieve`` is a collection of nonlinear Bayesian filters, in particular for high
dimensional models. The filters are implemented in python. It provides the
Transposed-Ensemble Kalman Filter (TEnKF) for state and likelihood inference, and the
Nonlinear Path-Adjusting Smoother (NPAS) for exact smoothed states.

``econsa`` is an open-source package for economists that facilitates the sound analysis
of computational economic models. It offers suitable methods for uncertainty propagation
and global sensitivity analysis. Please visit our online documentation for details.

``respy`` is an open-source framework written in Python for the simulation and
estimation of some finite-horizon discrete choice dynamic programming models. The group
of models which can be currently represented in `respy` are called Eckstein–Keane–Wolpin
models.

``pydsge`` is a Python package that allows to simulate, filter, and estimate DSGE models
with occassionaly binding constraints. As such, it allows to conduct full-blown Bayesian
estimations (including Bayesian filtering) of macroeconomic models featuring an
endogenous zero lower bound on nominal interest rates.

``ruspy`` is an open-source package for the simulation and estimation of a prototypical
infinite-horizon dynamic discrete choice model based on [Rust
(1987)](https://doi.org/10.2307/1911259){:target="_blank"}.

``grmpy`` is an open-source Python package for the simulation and estimation of the
generalized Roy model. It serves as a teaching tool to promote the conceptual framework
of the generalized Roy model, illustrate a variety of issues in the econometrics of
policy evaluation, and showcases basic software engineering practices.
