### optimagic
We started developing optimagic under the name estimagic out of a need to robustify
estimation of nonlinear economic models, including statistical inference. That
functionality is now a subpackage of optimagic, which is still called estimagic.
Optimagic now has its own organization on Github:
[optimagic-dev](https://github.com/optimagic-dev).

optimagic is a Python package for numerical optimization. It is a unified interface to
optimizers from SciPy, NlOpt and many other Python packages. optimagic’s `minimize`
function works just like SciPy’s. On top, you get access to more optimizers, powerful
diagnostic tools, parallel numerical derivatives and more.

### pybaum
pybaum provides tools to work with pytrees which is a concept borrowed from JAX.
Pytree's refer to tree-like structures built out of container-like Python objects.
