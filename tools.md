### estimagic
estimagic is a Python package to fit large-scale empirical models to data and make
inferences about the estimated model parameters. It is especially suited to solve
difficult optimization problems. It provides several advantages over similar packages,
including a unified interface that supports a large number of local and global
optimization algorithms and the possibility of monitoring the optimization procedure via
a beautiful interactive dashboard. It provides tools for nonlinear optimization,
numerical differentiation, and statistical inference.

### pybaum
pybaum provides tools to work with pytrees which is a concept borrowed from JAX.
Pytree's refer to tree-like structures built out of container-like Python objects. We
use pybaum in several of our packages. One notable example is estimagic.
