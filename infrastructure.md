We are developing the computational infrastructure in support of our initiative.

### OSE server

Our group maintains a small virtual sever for teaching and prototyping purposes. We can utilize up to 12 Cores and 16GB of RAM, depending on resource allocation within the entire network at the time. The virtual server will either run on Xeon E7-8837 or Xeon E5-2699 based servers which the IT service group of the economics department maintains.
