## Initiatives

### Econ-ARK

The [Econ-ARK](https://econ-ark.org){:target="_blank"} project provides open-source toolkits for researchers trying to understand how economic and social outcomes result from the actions of heterogeneous individuals. The primary goals of the project are to (1) make entry into the world of such modeling easy, (2) accelerate the development of this kind of modeling for policy-making and academic research, and (3) increase the openness, replicability, and interoperability of modeling tools. Econ-ARK is headed by [Christopher D. Carroll](http://www.econ2.jhu.edu/people/ccarroll/){:target="_blank"}, Professor of Economics at the Johns Hopkins University.

### QuantEcon

[QuantEcon](https://lectures.quantecon.org/py){:target="_blank"} is an initiative by [Thomas J. Sargent](http://www.tomsargent.com/){:target="_blank"} and [John Stachurski](http://johnstachurski.net){:target="_blank"}. It is very well suited for inexperienced programmers. Besides explaining some components of structural models in detailed and simple to follow tutorials, it also teaches the basics of Python and Julia.

## Scientific Programming

### Anaconda Distribution

The open-source [Anaconda Individual Edition](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution){:target="_blank"} is the easiest way to perform Python/R data science and machine learning on Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X. With over 19 million users worldwide, it is the industry standard for developing, testing, and training on a single machine.

### Jupyter Lab

[Jupyter Lab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io){:target="_blank"} is a web-based interactive development environment for Jupyter notebooks, code, and data. JupyterLab is flexible: configure and arrange the user interface to support a wide range of workflows in data science, scientific computing, and machine learning. JupyterLab is extensible and modular: write plugins that add new components and integrate with existing ones.

### Version Control

The [Introduction to Git and GitHub](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-git-github){:target="_blank"} course on coursera offers a well rounded intro into version control using Git and GitHub. It will teach you all the fundamentals as well as more advanced features.

The [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/resources/learn-git){:target="_blank"} video tutorial series provides you with the knowledge needed to start using Git. It covers the absolute basics as well as advanced procedures involving Git. The course consists of 15 concise videos split into three difficulty levels, all of which can be watched in under an hour.

### SciPy

[SciPy](https://www.scipy.org){:target="_blank"} is a Python-based ecosystem of open-source software for mathematics, science, and engineering. In particular, these are some of the core packages: ``numpy``, ``scipy``, ``matplotlib``, and ``pandas``.

### SciPy Lecture Notes

The [Scipy lecture notes](https://scipy-lectures.org){:target="_blank"} provide an excellent starting point for everyone interested in scientific programming in Python. They cover the main scientific packages of the Python ecosystem, namely ``numpy``, ``scipy`` and ``matplotlib``. Each chapter corresponds to a 1 to 2 hour course with the level of expertise increasing from beginner to expert.

**Resources**

* [Pandas Is for Everyone](https://youtu.be/3qDhDXNRgHE){:target="_blank"}

* [Introduction to Numerical Computing with NumPy](https://youtu.be/ZB7BZMhfPgk){:target="_blank"}

* [Exploratory data analysis in Python](https://youtu.be/W5WE9Db2RLU){:target="_blank"}

### Software Carpentry

[Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org){:target="_blank"} teaches researchers the computing skills they need to get more done in less time and with less pain. They have a lot of useful lessons on many different topics like Python and R programming or the Unix shell.

### statsmodels

``statsmodels`` is a Python module that provides classes and functions for the estimation of many different statistical models, as well as for conducting statistical tests, and statistical data exploration. An extensive list of result statistics are available for each estimator. The results are tested against existing statistical packages to ensure that they are correct.
