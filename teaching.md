### Effective Programming Practices for Economists

The course introduces students to programming methods that will substantially reduce
their time spent programming while at the same time making their programs more
dependable and their results reproducible without extra effort. The course draws
extensively on some simple techniques that are the backbone of modern software
development, which most economists are simply not aware of. It shows the usefulness of
these techniques for a wide variety of economic and econometric applications by means of
hands-on examples. Please see the slides from 19/20
[here](https://www.wiwi.uni-bonn.de/gaudecker/prog_econ_slides.html#prog-econ-slides).

### OSE Scientific Computing Course

The course provides an overview of basic numerical methods for optimization, numerical
integration, approximation methods, and uncertainty quantification. The last segment of
the course welcomes several guest lecturers from the industry and other academic
departments to present on how computational models are used in their everyday work.
Please see our [course website](https://ose-scientific-computing.readthedocs.io){:target="_blank"} for details.

### OSE Data Science Course

The course introduces students to basic microeconometric methods, where the objective is
to teach students how to perform and evaluate causal claims. The course is heavily based
on Python programming and makes use of its SciPy ecosystem, as well as Jupyter
Notebooks. In the same line as the Scientific Computing Course, the Data Science course
also welcomes guest Lecturers from both public and private sector who share their
insights on the importance of data science analysis. Please check our [course
