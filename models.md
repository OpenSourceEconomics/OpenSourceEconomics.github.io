### lcm
lcm (life-cycle models) aims to generalize and facilitate the specification, solving,
and estimation of dynamic choice models.

### sid
sid is an agent-based simulation model for infectious diseases like COVID-19. It scales
from simple examples to complex models which makes it an ideal tool for prototyping,
educational purposes, and research.

### respy
respy is an open-source framework written in Python for the simulation and
estimation of some finite-horizon discrete choice dynamic programming models. The group
of models which can be currently represented in `respy` are called Eckstein–Keane–Wolpin
models. [(Documentation)](https://respy.readthedocs.io){:target="_blank"}

### pydsge
pydsge is a Python package that allows to simulate, filter, and estimate DSGE models
with occasionally binding constraints. As such, it allows to conduct full-blown Bayesian
estimations (including Bayesian filtering) of macroeconomic models featuring an
endogenous zero lower bound on nominal interest rates.

### skillmodels
skillmodels a Python implementation of estimators for skill formation models.

### econsieve
econsive is a collection of nonlinear Bayesian filters, in particular for high
dimensional models. The filters are implemented in python. It provides the
Transposed-Ensemble Kalman Filter (TEnKF) for state and likelihood inference, and the
Nonlinear Path-Adjusting Smoother (NPAS) for exact smoothed states.

### ruspy
ruspy is an open-source package for the simulation and estimation of a prototypical
infinite-horizon dynamic discrete choice model based on [Rust
(1987)](https://doi.org/10.2307/1911259){:target="_blank"}.

### grmpy
grmpy is an open-source Python package for the simulation and estimation of the
generalized Roy model. It serves as a teaching tool to promote the conceptual framework
of the generalized Roy model, illustrate a variety of issues in the econometrics of
policy evaluation, and showcases basic software engineering practices.
