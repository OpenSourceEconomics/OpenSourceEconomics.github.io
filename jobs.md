### PhD student (m/f) in Computational Epidemiology

The [Interdisciplinary Research Unit Mathematics and Life Sciences](https://www.mathematics-and-life-sciences.uni-bonn.de/en){:target="_blank"} at the University of Bonn is looking for PhD students to work on projects in computational epidemiology.

One of the projects is a transdisciplinary collaboration between the research unit and Open Source Economics.

Project: *E<sup>2</sup>: Economics meets Epidemiology*

This project is located on the interface of epidemiology and (micro-)economics, and aims to understand the decision making of individuals and its influence on the current (and future) pandemics. Here, a novel mathematical modeling approach will be established with approaches from the different subfields.
