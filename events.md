We organize several events in support of our efforts.

### OSE meetup

We arrange monthly events which provide participants with an opportunity to present and learn about different software solutions, as well as to receive feedback on their current research projects. The events usually take place on the third Monday of every month at 6&nbsp;p.m. at the [Institute for Applied Microeconomics](https://www.iame.uni-bonn.de){:target="_blank"}. Please see our [website](https://github.com/OpenSourceEconomics/ose-meetup) for details.

### OSE retreat

We host an annual retreat in support of our research activities. We organize the event around the research codes that are under active development in our group to facilitate a productive exchange of ideas. While participants were initially limited to economists, we hope to expand the event and include the broader mathematics and computational science community going forward. Please see our [website](https://github.com/OpenSourceEconomics/ose-retreat) for details.

### OSE primer

We organize a computation primer, which is essentially an introduction to (Python) programming. The course covers basic concepts such as variables, loops, functions, plotting, basics of scientific programming and data analysis, and some perspectives. The last iteration can be found [here](https://github.com/OpenSourceEconomics/ose-course-primer).

### DSE Summer School

We are hosting the [Econometric Society Summer School in Dynamic Structural Econometrics (DSE)](https://dseconf.org){:target="_blank"} in Bonn in 2021. It offers an annual short course in dynamic structural econometrics and computational methods more generally, paired with an associated two day conference in the same general area. DSE conference and summer school have a special theme that varies from year to year.
