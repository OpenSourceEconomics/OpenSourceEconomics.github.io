We organize several events in support of our efforts.

### OSE meetup

We arrange monthly events which provide participants with an opportunity to present and learn about different software solutions, as well as to receive feedback on their current research projects. The events usually take place on the third Monday of every month at 6pm at the Institute of Applied Microeconomics. Please see our [website](https://github.com/OpenSourceEconomics/ose-meetup) for details.

### OSE retreat

We host an annual retreat in support of our research activities. We organize the event around the research codes that are under active development in our group to facilitate a productive exchange of ideas. While participants were initially limited to economists, we hope to expand the event and include the broader mathematics and computational science community going forward. Please see our [website](https://github.com/OpenSourceEconomics/ose-retreat) for details.
